# RSA Factoring Challenge

## Overview
This project, titled "RSA Factoring Challenge," is a coding challenge that involves factoring numbers used in RSA encryption. The goal is to factorize these numbers efficiently and quickly, as they might not always be generated with large enough prime numbers. This challenge offers an opportunity to test your factorization skills and contribute to the decryption of important documents.

## Background Context
Imagine you've stumbled upon an unsecured network and discovered numbers used to encrypt highly sensitive documents. It appears that these numbers aren't always created using sufficiently large prime numbers. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers as swiftly as possible before the responsible party fixes this vulnerability in their server. Successful factorization will enable the decryption of these important documents.

It's essential to note that this project is entirely optional and not mandatory. Participating in any part of this challenge will significantly boost your project grade, possibly exceeding 100%. However, opting not to participate won't negatively affect your score. Enjoy the challenge and have fun!
